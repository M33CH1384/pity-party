/**
 * Sound for the spray-paint screen transition (owner, 2026-10-23: "add
 * sound to it — not no cheesy sounds, let's get authentic"). The sounds
 * themselves live in the audio engine (sound.spraySoundStart/Stop — real
 * recorded can foley on the SFX channel, see CREDITS.md); this module is
 * only the wiring: it translates the spray controller's phase events into
 * engine calls, deriving every picture timing from spray.ts's own
 * constants, so retuning the animation can never desync the sound.
 *
 * The sync map (owner's staging, 2026-10-23):
 *  - SHAKE: a fresh cover opens with the can's rattle, leading the spray —
 *    it runs SPRAY_SHAKE_LEAD_S and finishes right as the hiss begins
 *    (the tagger shakes, then sprays). A snap-back re-cover gets no second
 *    shake: the tagger is already painting, the hiss just resumes.
 *  - HISS: continuous close-nozzle aerosol from the shake's end, tracking
 *    the outline + fill beats, then decaying across the first
 *    SPRAY_HISS_BLOOM_FADE_S of the bloom — silent before full black.
 *  - SILENCE: at full black (the swap + hold) and through the whole
 *    dissolve/reveal — nothing sprays on the way off.
 *  - CANCEL: a cancelled spray (table navigation, failsafe) cuts the
 *    sound with the paint — no orphaned hiss over the next screen.
 * A suppressed spray (Reduce effects / OS reduce-motion) never changes
 * phase, so it never sounds: the sound belongs to the animation, not to
 * navigation in general. Cover timers here mirror the controller's own
 * setTimeout discipline; a phase event always wins over a pending timer.
