/**
 * A called misdeal gets a real moment, in the game's own motion language — never a silent swap:
 *  1. ANNOUNCE + GATHER (`MISDEAL_REVEAL_MS`): the call is announced — who called it, why
 *     (no spades), and who the deal passes to — with the thrown hand face up as the table's
 *     proof, while every hand glides across to the INCOMING dealer's deck spot on the same
 *     glide the end-of-hand collection uses (a misdeal passes the deal like a normal end of
 *     hand, so the pile travels to the seat about to deal). Bids already placed die with the
 *     hand, and the announcement says so.
 *  2. SHUFFLE + DEAL OUT: the card layer restarts the hand's deal (same hand number, fresh deal
 *     epoch), so the normal shuffle + deal flight replays — shuffled and dealt out of the new
 *     dealer's hands, since the deck spot sits in front of whoever holds the deal — a touch
 *     brisker than a fresh hand (`MISDEAL_DEAL_SPEED`) to keep the moment near three seconds.
 *  3. Bidding opens when the last card lands.
 * The ANNOUNCEMENT's on-screen life is longer than the sequence's: it holds for
 * MISDEAL_REVEAL_DWELL_MS (or a tap) even though the redeal finishes underneath
 * it — the cards are the table's proof and get reading time, while play is
 * never held hostage to them (the hold is Table-local presentation state).
 * The sequence rides each source's `dealing` flag for its FULL length (bots, input and dealt
 * slots all wait), online and solo alike, because the reveal rides the synced view
 * (`PlayerView.misdealReveal`) — every seat's client runs the same sequence off the same event.
 * Reduced motion collapses it to the announcement + instant swap.
 *
 * THE FAN DURING THE SEQUENCE (owner, 2026-10-21): "I shouldn't have cards until they are
 * dealt to me as per the usual deal." The state swap is atomic, so the redealt hand exists
 * in state from the first frame of the announcement — but no fan may SHOW it before the
 * deal flight deals it. During the gather beat the local fan holds the hand being THROWN IN
 * (snapshotted from the last committed render before the swap): those are the cards riding
 * the glide into the pile — for the caller they are the public reveal itself; for any other
 * viewer, their own hand they were just holding. With no snapshot to hold (a client whose
 * first render already carries the reveal), the fan is honestly empty until the deal.
 * The deal beat then deals the new hand out of the deck on the normal per-card flight —
 * the fan's appearance is the flight's doing, never the state swap's.

 * the redeal sequence: the gather + deal flight run their normal course
 * underneath, and the announcement is not yanked when they finish — it holds
