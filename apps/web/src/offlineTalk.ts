/**
 * Offline trash talk: the same engine as the server, driven by the local game (useGame reports each step).
 * Table.tsx sets the table (names, team names) and the sink that posts lines to the chat.
 *
 * Revolutionaries tributes (revTributes.ts in @spades/bots) ride this driver:
 * while the history deck is the active deck, court plays and the Malcolm cut
 * are detected here, ahead of the generic moment engine — the signature
 * pre-empts the step's line, a regular tribute only speaks when the engine
 * didn't. Table.tsx says whether this is the Barbershop story table (revShop),
 * where Coleman and June carry the lines as story characters; everywhere else
 * the bot who threw the card speaks, and a human's card gets a bot witness.
 *
 * Speech density (2026-10-22) also lives here, on top of the engine's
 * per-class profiles (TALK_PROFILES in @spades/bots):
 * - MIX HIERARCHY: Table.tsx reports higher-priority speech (scripted scene
 *   beats, signature sets, tributes, rail, consultation) through
 *   noteHighPriority/noteConsult, stamping voiceBusyUntil. A generic line
 *   that would REPLACE such a line (start before busyUntil − 3 s, the
 *   engine's tail-overlap window) is dropped, never queued — density comes
 *   from trigger frequency, not a backlog commenting on old tricks.
 * - ANSWER CHAINS: a delivered generic line may be answered — an
 *   opponent's roast (65%) or the partner's trickPop co-sign (35%) —
 *   rolled per class (answerP, halving per link, maxChain). The answer
 *   RIDES the first line's tail (answerWaitMs): finishing someone's
 *   sentence means entering as their line lands, not a beat of dead
 *   air after it (owner, 2026-10-22, on the twins). Answers are the
 *   lowest-priority speech in the room and the first dropped.
 * - CONSULTATION RIGHT OF WAY: while a consultation line is playing (or
 *   within 600 ms after), generic bid-event talk is dropped, not queued.
 * - DECISION PROTECTION: no generic line with a clip over 2.5 s starts
 *   while the human has a pending bid/play decision (Table.tsx maintains
 *   humanDeciding). Reactions to the human's own just-completed action are
 *   exempt; the only other in-think speech is the murmur.
 * - MURMURS: on the human's clock, after a class-defined silence, one
 *   short (≤ 2 s) trickPop pop from a bot seat; at most twice per turn.
 * - ANTI-REPEAT: the same text from two different speakers inside 60 s is
 *   suppressed (cross-speaker dedupe), on top of the engine's shuffle-bag.
