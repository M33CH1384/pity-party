/**
 * The Card Fan — the transition program for PROFILE + SOCIAL moves
 * (owner, 2026-10-23: "Build them all" — stage 2 of the family).
 *
 * Nine abstract card backs fan up from a pivot below the screen's
 * bottom edge and open until the CARDS THEMSELVES cover the whole
 * screen — the swap lands under full fan cover — then the fan lifts
 * off the top and is gone. ~850 ms end to end: brisker than the
 * spray, because these moves are quick peeks (a profile, the social
 * panel), not journeys. The cards are the game's own idiom
 * abstracted: deep felt backs, a keyline border, the spade mark
 * watermarked large — never literal players' cards. Both themes run
 * the same fan; under Neon the felt goes ink-violet and the mark
 * glows cyan (visuals only).
 *
 * WHOLE-SCREEN COVERAGE (owner, on the first fan: "The fan should
 * cover the whole screen not just the bottom"). The first fan sized
 * its cards off the viewport's width alone, so they topped out in
 * the screen's lower fifth and a dark shade did the rest of the
 * covering — a fan sitting at the bottom, not a fan that IS the
 * cover. fanLayout() below derives the geometry from the viewport
 * itself: every card runs from the shared pivot (just below the
 * bottom edge) to past the farthest corner — length = the
 * pivot-to-corner distance, with overshoot, at true playing-card
 * aspect — and the spread opens past the corner angle, so at full
 * cover the union of the nine card bodies contains the entire
 * viewport, top corners included. A dark shade still sits behind
 * the cards, but only as a gap-filler for the slivers between card
 * edges: no region of the screen is shade alone. The coverage is
 * pinned in transitions.test.ts (all four corners plus a fine grid,
 * computed from fanLayout/fanCardContains at phone and desktop
 * sizes) so "fan at the bottom" fails CI if it ever regresses.
 *
 * Same family discipline as the spray (see transitions.ts): ONLY
 * WAAPI tweens of transform/opacity over static DOM — zero per-frame
 * painting, ever. Motion resumes mid-flight on a re-cover snap-back
 * exactly like the spray's (negative delay from the snapshot's
 * fromCoverage).
