 * The mode gate's answer, remembered for the tab session (owner,

 * game flashes and takes me back to the menu asking if I want to
 * play solo or co-op — if I try a second time it works").
 *
 * The flash is the chunk self-heal doing its job: a deploy deletes
 * the previous build's hashed chunks (chunkLoad.ts), so a page
 * opened before the deploy — his predated f07f2131, which changed
 * Table.tsx + beatPacing.ts inside this route's chunk graph — asks
 * for a chunk that no longer exists, and importChunk reloads the
 * document once onto the new build. The reload is correct. What it
 * destroyed was this: the gate's answer was in-memory state, and
 * `mode` is never set back to null inside the component, so the
 * gate can only reappear through a fresh mount — the heal's reload
 * re-asked a question the player had already answered, and the
 * retry then worked because the new boot's chunks all resolve.
 *
 * The answer now lives in sessionStorage — the same tab-scoped
 * lifetime as the heal's own reload flag — and a heal reload that
 * lands back on this screen restores it instead of re-asking (see
 * initialStoryMode below).
 *
 * What the remembered answer is NOT (owner, 2026-10-24): a pass for
 * the rest of the session. Reading it back on every mount made
 * co-op unreachable from the front door — start a solo run, go
 * Home, tap Story Mode again, and the remembered 'solo' rode
 * straight to the solo map; with a match in progress, Home's only
 * story row was Resume, so the pair run had no door at all. The
 * answer is now read back in exactly one case: this document is a
 * reload of the story screen itself (the heal's landing, or the
 * player's own refresh mid-visit). Every deliberate entry is asked
 * at the gate like a first visit, solo run or no solo run.
