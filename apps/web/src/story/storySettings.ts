/**
 * Story Mode: turn a stop definition into the Settings snapshot + TableRules
 * the offline table already understands. Twists ride the existing
 * settings/house-rules machinery (mode, target, blind-nil availability);
 * the parts with no Settings knob (nil value, blind-nil value, per-stop
 * timers) are applied as scoped rules overrides for THIS game only — the
 * player's saved settings are never touched, and no global rule changes.
 *
 * The house deck rides the same scoped snapshot: a story table deals the
 * stop's OWN matched deck (storyDecks' stop→deck map), not the player's
 * selected deck — it's the house's deck on their turf. Table activates
 * whatever deck its settings snapshot carries, so backs and faces match
 * for all four seats. Clearing the stop is what lets the player take the
 * deck home in the picker; playing AT the stop never required owning it.
