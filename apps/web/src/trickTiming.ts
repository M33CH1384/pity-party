/**
 * Timing shared by the table and the 3D cards for a trick that just resolved.
 * The last-trick nuke is the sharp case: the server finishes the trick (and the hand) in one
 * state. The client has to hold that trick on the first paint, or the blast starts over a table
 * that already swept. (The old auto-play stagger — every auto-played card flying in together —
 * is gone: an armed nuke waits for every seat to throw, then detonates on the completed trick.)
 *
 * Hand end (the score screen) is a different clock from the mid-hand sweep:
 *  - normal: HAND_END_REVEAL_MS from the play (700 ms after the 500 ms flight, at normal speed)
 *  - nuke: the mid-hand trick hold plus that level's allowance, then the score — the blast is the wait
 *  - Run it!: RUN_SHOW_MS, then the score — the tornado is the wait
 * Scoring toasts (3200 ms) and the old 1200 ms beat used to run after all of these. They don't anymore.
