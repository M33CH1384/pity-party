 * Bid Wit Me sound engine (Web Audio).

 * - Musical cues (turn chime, stingers, jingles, spades-broken sting, whoosh, buzz) and the optional lounge ambience
 *   are synthesized here with oscillators/noise — no extra files.
 * - iOS/Safari only allow audio after a user gesture: the context is created/resumed on the first

 *   An 'interrupted' or closed context is rebuilt. If it stays suspended, the header speaker
 *   shows a needs-tap state; tapping that icon resumes or rebuilds inside the gesture.
 *   (The iPhone silent switch mutes Web Audio; there is no way around that from a web page.)
