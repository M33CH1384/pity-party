/**
 * Per-stop SET ANIMATIONS (owner, 2026-10-21): every story stop has its own
 * celebration for when a side gets set at the table, in TWO tiers — the
 * regular set, and the FINALE for a set that ends the game (the escalated
 * version of the same scenario). Both tiers unlock together when the player
 * CLEARS the stop, derived client-side from story progress exactly like the
 * story decks (storyDecks.ts) — no server grant machinery.
 *
 * NO FREE DEFAULTS (owner, 2026-10-21 12:04): the old caution-tape (regular)
 * and white-sheet (finale) treatments are retired from rotation — nothing
 * selects them, earned or not. A player who has earned nothing and is not at
 * a story stop sees NO set animation: the hand resolves with normal scoring
 * and feedback only.
 *
 * HOUSE RULE (the house-deck model, shipped 84af094d): at a story stop, the
 * room's own animation is the room's celebration in its own house — it plays
 * at that stop whether or not the player has cleared it yet (venue flavor,
 * and a preview of what the clear earns). The clear earns taking it home:
 * picker ownership + use in any other match.
