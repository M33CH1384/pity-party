 * Story cross-talk (owner, the Porch 2026-10-22: "only one person can talk
 * at a time… if Pat says something, Unc can start before she finishes and
 * they both continue at times"). Until now the voice channel was strictly
 * serial — a new line cut the playing one, every time (startVoice's
 * stopVoice). On story surfaces a conversational line may now start over
 * the TAIL of a different speaker's line: max two voices, the first
 * ducked ≈ −6 dB and restored if it outlives the second, same speaker
 * still cuts, and the variation is a roll so it lands like people, not a
 * metronome. These tests pin the pure plan, the speakBot opt-in wiring,
 * and the engine's duck/restore application. Source selection keeps the
 * story fence (cast recording or text only): in scope, catalog lines
 * attempt the cast route only — see the fence pins below.
