/**
 * Misdeal, browser-level (WebKit 390): a spade-less human hand gets the 'Call misdeal' button;
 * calling it announces the call ("You called it · no spades") and the dealer pass with the whole
 * hand face up as the table's proof while the hands gather across to the incoming dealer
 * (~1.2s beat), then the hand is shuffled and redealt out of that seat on the normal deal
 * flight (still bidding, fresh cards, no bid placed). The announcement itself now dwells
 * a full 8s (owner, 2026-10-25 — the cards "flash too quick" at the beat's lifetime) or
 * until the player taps it away; the redeal runs its course underneath it. The save deals from seat 3, so the
 * human's call passes the deal TO the human: the announcement reads "Deal passes to you".
 * Fan ruling (owner, 2026-10-21): "I shouldn't have cards until they are dealt to me as per
 * the usual deal" — through the whole announcement beat the player's fan (the accessible
 * hand group here) still holds the THROWN-IN hand; the redealt hand appears only as the
 * deal flight deals it. This save is a resumed hand, so it also covers the redeal flight
 * replaying on a hand with no intro.
 * Saves docs/misdeal-button-390.png and docs/misdeal-reveal-390.png when BWM_SHOTS=docs.
