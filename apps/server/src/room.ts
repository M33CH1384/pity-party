/**
 * The game room: everything a Table Durable Object does, minus the Cloudflare plumbing, so it can be
 * unit-tested with mock sockets and a fake clock. The server is the referee (spec §4.2):
 *  - it shuffles/deals (packages/rules), validates every bid/play, and only ever sends a seat its own view;
 *  - bots (packages/bots) fill empty seats and play from that seat's view only;
 *  - human turns have a deadline from that table's timer; a disconnect waits the same length
 *    (not a fixed 10s) and then the bot logic plays that turn. The seat stays the human's unless they explicitly leave;
 *  - all durable state lives in one plain-JSON `RoomData` object that the DO saves as a single row.
