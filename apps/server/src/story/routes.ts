/**
 * Story Mode HTTP routes (Phase 1 — solo route):
 *   GET  /api/story/progress?track=solo   → the caller's progress on a track
 *   POST /api/story/session { state: 'open'|'closed', stopId?, track? }
 *        → a story match opened/closed on this device (call-back nudges,
 *          see callback.ts; server-stamped, never a progress write)
 *   POST /api/story/result { track?, stopId, won, gameId }
 *        → record a finished solo stop game: attempt always recorded; a win
 *          clears the stop (server-validated sequential unlock), pays the
 *          first-clear reward once (or the small replay upkeep), and the
 *          King clear stamps the track's completion mark. A loss pays the
 *          small consolation (STORY_LOSS_REWARD — flat 5 XP, no coins),
 *          once per gameId like every reward here.
 *          THE KING'S DOUBLE (doubleOrNothing): a first King win records
 *          the attempt + sets a pending mark (migration 0024) and pays
 *          NOTHING; only a win posted while the mark stands clears — for
 *          double the first-clear reward. A loss while pending voids both
 *          legs. The mark lives on the stop's story_progress row, so the
 *          reset-stop DELETE wipes a live double with the row.
 *   POST /api/story/reset-stop { track?, stopId }
 *        → owner-only dev tool: wipe ONE stop's progress/claims/finds/
 *          session on the caller's own solo track so its next win presents
 *          as a first clear again. No XP/coin clawback (see the branch).
 *
 * Server-authoritative, like the rest of Rep: the client reports only which
 * stop it finished and whether its side won (the same trust level as the
 * offline-game upload, /api/stats/local — offline games are rebuilt and
 * checked there; story stops are offline games, so progress writes are
 * unlock-checked and reward-capped here). Rewards are computed from the stop
 * number by @spades/bots storyReward — never from client-sent amounts.
 * Idempotent per gameId: re-posting the same finished game returns the
 * stored outcome without re-crediting or re-counting the attempt.
 *
 * Story matches are UNRATED: nothing here touches ratings/season_ratings,
 * and the solo game itself is an offline game whose local upload is
 * suppressed client-side so it can't be double-counted as a normal bot game.
 *
 * Tracks: Phase 1 writes the 'solo' track only. The track-key shape
 * ('pair:<uidA>:<uidB>', see storyPairTrackKey in @spades/bots) is validated
 * now so Phase 2 co-op writes land in the same tables unchanged.
