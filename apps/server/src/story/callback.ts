/**
 * Story Mode call-backs (owner, 2026-10-21): when a story match sits
 * unfinished, the seated characters themselves call the player back to the
 * table by push notification — in their own voices.
 *
 * The story save is device-local (localStorage 'bwm.storySave.v1'), so the
 * client reports session state through POST /api/story/session (see
 * routes.ts): 'open' on save create/checkpoint, 'closed' on finish /
 * discard / resume-completion. Sessions live in story_sessions
 * (migration 0023), one open row per (user, track), stamped with SERVER
 * receive times only — client clocks never drive the schedule.
 *
 * The sweep rides the Worker's hourly cron (index.ts scheduled handler,
 * alongside runScheduledPushes):
 *   · first call-back after ~5h away from an open session
 *   · one "last call" after ~24h away
 *   · then silence — at most 2 nudges per session, ever
 *   · sessions expire for nudge purposes 7 days after they opened
 * A nudge is only counted as sent when the push layer actually delivered
 * it to at least one live subscription (pref off / no subscription costs
 * the player nothing — the call simply stays pending until expiry).
 * Delivery, per-type prefs, cooldown-free fan-out and dead-subscription
 * pruning are the push layer's (push/send.ts sendPushToUser).
