/**
 * RAILBIRDS (owner, 2026-10-21): the neighborhood is one world — characters
 * from earlier stops stand on the rail at later ones, chiming in from time
 * to time. Spades is a communal game; the rail is that community.
 *
 * Rules (hard):
 *  - A railbird is always someone the player has already MET: their home
 *    stop is at or before this stop (the route unlocks sequentially, so
 *    reaching a stop guarantees the meetings). Reunions, never strangers.
 *  - Never a seated player at this stop (not the pair, not Dee).
 *  - Chime-ins are SPARSE and event-keyed (the same substrate as the
 *    scene channel): a handful per match at most (RAIL_CAPS), never on
 *    top of a scripted beat. The grit stops run thin; the King runs
 *    nearly silent — presence itself is the statement.
 *  - Variants key off stored facts only (attempts at the railbird's own
 *    stop, stops cleared) — never invented history.
 *  - Railbirds never affect gameplay. They are witnesses.
 *
 * CAMEO VARIETY (owner, 2026-10-21): the rail is NOT the same room every
 * retry. When an attempt starts, its rail cast is DRAWN from the eligible
 * pool (railCastForAttempt — seeded by stop + attempt number, so the draw
 * is deterministic for a given attempt, different from the attempt before
 * it by construction, and persisted in the story session so a resumed
 * match restores the exact same faces). Caps are ceilings, not quotas:
 * some attempts run a thin rail, some none at all. The King is the one
 * exception — his rail is FULL every attempt; that crowd is the payoff.
 *
 * EXCHANGES (owner, 2026-10-21): a rail moment can become a short
 * back-and-forth with the table (railMomentFor): the railbird speaks, a
 * seated player answers, the railbird may get one comeback — 2–3 lines,
 * then it dies. Three seeded outcomes per eligible moment: solo chime-in,
 * an exchange (rarer, stricter caps), or the moment passes in silence.
 *
 * Rail lines are story lines: they join the voice-bake corpus under each
 * character's STORY_VOICE_CAST casting.
