/**
 * Story Mode secrets (owner, 2026-10-21): one EASTER EGG and one UNLOCKABLE
 * per stop, as content. Neither gates progress. Found state and feats are
 * recorded server-side (story_finds + the Rep unlocks table); nothing here
 * is marked on the map before it's found — the egg's name only appears once
 * discovered, and its hint only shows after the stop is cleared.
 *
 * Egg trigger types (all honestly keyed to real things):
 *  - 'sceneTap'   a hidden spot in the stop's intro scene backdrop
 *  - 'deeTap'     tapping Dee's medallion repeatedly in the scene
 *  - 'matchEvent' a real in-match event (Dee makes a nil, a side is set on
 *                 hand 1, …) — granted server-side from the result facts
 *  - 'chain'      arriving at this stop with an earlier stop's egg in hand
 *
 * Unlockable feats are evaluated server-side from the result payload's
 * honestly-computed game facts (StoryGameFacts — computed by the client
 * from the finished game's own hand history, the same trust level as the
 * offline result post). `needsWin` feats only grant on a win.
