 * Bot trash talk engine (pure; the server and the offline game both drive it, so online lines come from the server).

 * - Cooldowns: one bot line at a time (global gap), each bot rests between lines; big moments get a shorter gap.
 * - Pre-play lines never see the card about to be played (no tells): prePlayLine() takes no card/hand at all.
 * - Hustler persona plays dumb ('newbie' pool) until it pulls off a cut / lead-taking spade / set, then reveals once.
