/**
 * Story Tale of the Tape (owner, 2026-10-21): the Big Bank tape's shape,
 * filled with NARRATIVE context instead of player stats — who each
 * character is, what they're known for, their honest table tell, and the
 * bond the scene plays on. The stakes line is the stop's own. Dee's entry
 * EVOLVES with the route (banded by stop number — stored-fact-driven via
 * the same facts the scene selector uses). One history row, and only when
 * a stored fact (attempts/clears at this stop) supports it: no fabricated
 * records, no invented numbers for bots. Threat is design data, in plain
 * language.
