/**
 * Demetrius's "Hood Spades" trash-talk pack (docs/trash-talk-pack.md), as data. personas.ts spreads every line onto 2-3
 * personas of the section's style group (deterministic), so each line is voiced by the personas that say it.
 *
 * Line markup (stripped before use, kept in LINE_META):
 *   leading '!'  → needs Cookout or No Mercy        leading '!!' → No Mercy only
 *   ' @ace'      → only when an Ace was just cut     ' @neg' → only when the target side is below 0
 *   ' @big' / ' @little' → only for that Joker      ' @jk'  → only in Joker decks
 *   '[a,b] '     → say-it-only personas (overrides the section group)
 * Templates: {bid} real bid number, {their} his/her/their by the target's name, {them} the target's name.
