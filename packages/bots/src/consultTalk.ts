/**
 * Pre-bid partner consultation (CONSULT_SPEC.md): before bidding, the human's
 * bot partner says how many books they think they have — out loud, in their
 * own recorded voice where a take exists, never robotically identical.
 *
 * DATA HONESTY is the whole design: the spoken claim, the bid coach's
 * "thinks N", and the partner's placed bid are all views of ONE number —
 * `partnerBidIntent()` on the partner's own view, with its default seeded
 * rng (the same stream the bot's real bid is drawn from). This module never
 * invents a number: it decomposes that claim C onto the Sure/Possible grid
 * (§3.1/§3.2) purely to choose HOW the number is said.
 *
 * HARD RULE (§7): no line here states or implies what cards anyone holds —
 * no ranks, no suits, no card names, no distribution talk, never the word
 * "trump". Speech carries the count, the possibles, the confidence, and the
 * score context only. The forbidden-pattern linter in
 * packages/bots/test/consult-linter.test.ts enforces it over every line,
 * fully instantiated.
 *
 * Clip keys (the consultation bake, fb581d61): grid takes key as
 * `${raw}#${S}.${P}` with S bucketed 0–5 then "6+", settle takes as
 * `${raw}#T${bucket}` with T bucketed 3–12 then "13+", number-free lines
 * key by their raw text. A lookup that misses renders TEXT ONLY under the
 * standing fence rules — never a substitute voice.
