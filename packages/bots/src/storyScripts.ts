/**
 * Story Mode SCENES (scene pass, 2026-10-21 — owner: "it should be like
 * sitting in a scene from a movie… more energy between the characters, rich,
 * telling a story"). Every stop is written as a scripted multi-character
 * scene with an arc: an intro with a real stake, a win scene that pays the
 * stake off, a lose scene that cuts the other way, and a loss-return intro.
 * Characters talk TO EACH OTHER at least as much as to the player; Dee is in
 * every scene, and her arc (green → believing → belonging) is the spine.
 *
 * Tone: grounded neighborhood drama — warmth and humor on the surface, real
 * stakes, history and quiet menace underneath; dialogue with subtext; what
 * it costs to climb. Original characters and lines throughout.
 *
 * Continuity is FACT-DRIVEN, never faked: a line that references an earlier
 * stop (or Dee's growth, or a prior loss) lives in the `gated` lists below
 * and only fires when the stored fact it names is true for this track
 * (cleared stop ids from the progress endpoint). `beatsFor` merges gated
 * lines into the scene at their marked positions.
 *
 * The scene continues DURING the game: each stop also carries mid-scene
 * beats and table exchanges (see STORY_MID_SCENES / STORY_TABLE_EXCHANGES
 * below), keyed to real game milestones and hand flow — never random pools.
 *
 * REBALANCE (2026-10-21, owner: "most of the convo is happening on the intro
 * screen instead of at the table — the game itself should be the
 * experience"): the intro is a SHORT sit-down (≤5 beats; returns/cleared
 * bands 3; the King ≤6 — he carries the double-or-nothing terms beat and
 * one extra ceremony beat). The arc the long intros used to narrate moved
 * INTO the match verbatim: each stop's signature story beat now fires at
 * the `midgame` milestone (after hand 2) from STORY_MID_SCENES.signature,
 * and Dee's own made nil earns a memory-gated endgame callback
 * (STORY_CALLBACKS.deeNilMade). Outros are closers (win ≤4, loss ≤3; the
 * King's win keeps 5 — the graduation). Caps are pinned in the bots tests.

 *
 * Three landings, all keyed to RECORDED facts and nothing else:
 *  1. REPLAY RECOGNITION (intros): returning to a cleared stop while
 *     the route stands further along — the pair greets a known name,
 *     names the REAL current stop, and Dee relays how the advancing
 *     win went (relay voice: heard, word is, word travels — secondhand
 *     news, never an omniscient announcer). Decisive wins leave the
 *     current stop's pair holding smoke for him (inverted smoke).
 *  2. REPLAY OUTRO SWAP: a replay win's onward beats (StoryBeat.next)
 *     are replaced by the truth — the real current stop, or the
 *     route-complete fact. The Porch also reacts to THIS game's manner.
 *  3. FORWARD BUZZ (in-match at the current stop): the seated pair has
 *     heard how he handled the PREVIOUS stop — smoke for a decisive
 *     win, war stories for a squeaker, plain word for a solid one,
 *     honest grind when the latest there was a loss. Opportunistic:
 *     buzzMomentFor rides the same seeded-roll + cap discipline as the
 *     rail (storyRail) — never guaranteed, never twice a match.
 *
