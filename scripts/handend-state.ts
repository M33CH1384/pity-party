 * Offline save for the hand-end check (e2e): hand 2, last trick, both Jokers about to meet, my team bid 10 (Wheels).
 * Seat 1 led the Little Joker, seats 2 and 3 followed; I (seat 0) hold only the Big Joker. Playing it nukes the trick,
 * my team takes its 10th book (Wheels made) and the hand ends on a nuke → the score screen waits out the blast, then opens.
